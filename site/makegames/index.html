    <h1 id="so-you-wanna-make-games">So you wanna make games</h1>
<p>Making games is very fun, and NOT as difficult as most people think.</p>
<p>I've broken it down into actionable steps, taking advice from people I've seen learn game development as well as my own personal experiences. </p>
<h2 id="step-1-learn-to-code">Step 1: Learn to code.</h2>
<p>Assuming you're working by yourself. Video games are computer software, and somebody at some point needs to write the software (although depending on the <a href="" title="/">tools</a> you use to make the game, more or less programming will be required).</p>
<p>This isn't a required step, some people have learned to code though making games, but depending on what you want to make and what you want to use, taking the time to set up a foundation outside of game development could be useful</p>
<h2 id="step-2-pick-something-to-make-games-with">Step 2: Pick something to make games with</h2>
<p>The software you'll use to make your game.</p>
<p>Pick Godot. If you want to be a free thinker instead, you can read the rest of this section.</p>
<p>(If you still can't decide then pick Godot)</p>
<h3 id="engine-or-a-library">Engine or a Library</h3>
<p>Game Libraries are usually like other libraries/packages that can be installed or maintained on your programming language of choice. They're usually minimal and focus on the fundamental things you'd need to make a game in that programming language, like rendering sprites/models onto a screen, inputs, collisions, ECS)</p>
<p>They're simpler, in the sense that you need to understand a lot less of someone else's code, but they take longer to do things, because you need to write a lot more of your own code.</p>
<p>It's kind of like driving a manual car. If you aren't into cars (developing game systems, in this simile) then you'd think driving manual is a lot of extra work you don't want to do, and would rather focus on where you're driving (the design/content of the game you're making)</p>
<p>You should use a game library if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You really like the language the library is built with.</li>
<li>You don't want to learn a completely original system, and enjoy building out systems yourself.</li>
<li>You're looking to make small or very lean games</li>
<li>You're interested in learning the fundamentals of game programming and want to know how things work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Engines, on the other hand, are large, bespoke software applications designed to make games within. These are what most commercial games are made within, and what most people these days use.</p>
<p>They come with large sets of common tools, build in GUI editors and interfaces for all aspects of your game, and lots of plugins to extend functionality.</p>
<p>You should use a game engine if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to make games as fast as possible</li>
<li>Want to focus on building things specific to <em>your game</em>, not generic systems that lots of games would use</li>
<li>You want to make 3d games (you <em>can</em> make 3d games with a library but... that's rough.)</li>
<li>You don't mind learning a new system that extends your existing programming skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>A (hopefully exhaustive) list of engines and libraries is available <a href="/docs/tools.md">here</a></p>
<h2 id="step-3-learn-how-to-use-it">Step 3: Learn how to use it</h2>
<p>to write:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow tutorials</li>
<li>don't fall into tutorial hell, extend tutorials to add extra features after they're over</li>
<li>put different tutorials together to make a new game</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-4-learn-how-to-finish-your-projects">Step 4: Learn how to finish your projects</h2>
<p>Most beginners start with lofty ambitions of a "dream game", the one that motivated them to learn how to make games in the first place.</p>
<p>okay I'm getting tired and will finish this up tomorrow:</p>
<ul>
<li>split your dream game into component parts that can be learned in different projects</li>
<li>make the smallest game you can, and then scope out (2 hours, 2 days, 2 weeks, 1 month)</li>
<li>participate in jams for motivation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-5-learn-how-to-make-fun-games">Step 5: Learn how to make fun games</h2>
<p>to write:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can make game, now it time to make fun game</li>
<li>learn game design </li>
</ul>
