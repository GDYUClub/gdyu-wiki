# Tools to make games
I had simply linked to the [magic tools repo](https://github.com/ellisonleao/magictools), and though that would suffice for an exhaustive list (exhaustive it sure is), but I think a list curated by GDYU members would be a lot less intimidating, and would allow members to make more informed decisions.

If none of the tools here suit your needs, check out the [magic tools repo](https://github.com/ellisonleao/magictools)

## Generic Learning Resources
Things to teach you general concepts not specific to any one tool or language.

### [Video Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)
- A great book about data structures, and programming patterns commonly used to build good codebases.

### [Amit's Game Programming information](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/gameprog.html)
- Webpage filled with a collection of other game development resources

### [20 Games Challenge]('https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/')
- a site with 10 game ideas that increase in complexity. Good list to work through if you're learning a new tool or want to practice making things without following tutorials 

## Game Engines

### [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- Free and open source 2D/3D Game Engine.
- Everyone's new best friend, it's the most feature complete open source game engine.
- Language Support: GDScript (it's like python), C#,C++/C or [anything sorta?](https://github.com/Vivraan/godot-lang-support)
#### Learning Resources:
- [Offical Intro Tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html)
- [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)

### [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- Free 2D/3D Game Engine
- Everything is made in this one.
- Well not *everything*, but if it's an indie game from the last 15 years there's like a 80% chance it was made in Unity (Although their market share might've [slipped a bit](https://www.polygon.com/23885373/unity-technologies-install-fee-pricing-change))
- Language support: C# (or any .NET language)
#### Learning Resources

[3D first person shooter](https://youtu.be/gPPGnpV1Y1c?si=wflMZ7ZhNqg2U33E)
Then there are just YT channels in general that have lots of good tutorial content.

### [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)
- Epic Games' 3d game engine (you can also do 2d in it, but it's not designed for it and it's kinda overkill)
- It's a big boy for big games, you've definitely seen the unreal engine logo in front of some major AAA video games.
- It's huge and demands a beefy computer, but if you're really looking for *Big Graphics*, this is the engine for that.

- But buy it, it's worth it.
